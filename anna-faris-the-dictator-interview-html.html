Her lips appear to be doing calisthenics as she forms words, and her eyes widen whenever she makes a wry comment — like when she says she expected to be working at Starbucks, instead of starring in films. At the time of the interview, she had yet to announce her pregnancy with her husband, Parks and Rec actor Chris Pratt, and there was certainly no evidence on her diminutive frame. As she curled up on a lushly upholstered couch at the Waldorf Astoria while promoting<i> </i>the Sacha Baron Cohen fascist romp <i>The Dictator</i>, Faris talked about her role as a crunchy Brooklyn cause-haver, her dreams for a remote theater refuge in the Pacific Northwest, and playing idiots.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-3-0-0@published data-word-count=21><b>I saw The Dictator last night.

I mean, I think it’s still scary for Hollywood to sort of commit money to a messy woman. And to a lesser extent, but to some degree, a messy guy as well. But yeah, I do think it’s shifted the conversation because it used to be the conversation when I was pitching movies was always like, “Well, what’s it rated?” And if we said R it was like, “Well, no, it’s got to be PG-13.” Or, either that or the conversation was like, “How do we make this girl likable?” So then you’re forced with the burden of like, winning. You know, the whole cliché is like you want the women in the audience to want you to be their best friend, and the men in the audience to fall in love with you.
