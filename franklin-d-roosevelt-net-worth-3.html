Roosevelt was born into a wealthy and prominent family in 1882. His father, James Roosevelt, left him a small inheritance upon his death, but the majority of the family’s wealth went to Franklin’s mother, Sara Delano.</p><p>Roosevelt received a private education and attended Harvard College, where he obtained a degree in history. He later dropped out of Columbia Law School after passing the bar exam. Throughout his early life, Roosevelt relied on his family’s wealth and the financial support of his mother.</p><h2>Start of Political Career</h2><p>In 1910, Franklin D. Roosevelt embarked on his political career by running for a seat in the New York State Senate. He successfully won the election and served a term, where he focused on advocating for and passing legislation related to farm and labor issues.</p><p>“The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.” – Franklin D. Roosevelt</p><p>In 1913, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s political journey took another significant turn when he was appointed as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy by President Woodrow Wilson. In this role, he played a crucial part in establishing the US Navy Reserve and the Council of National Defense, further solidifying his influence in the political landscape.</p><h3>New York State Senate</h3><ul><li>Won election to the New York State Senate in 1910</li><li>Focused on passing legislation related to farm and labor issues</li><li>Advocated for workers’ rights and agricultural reforms</li></ul><h3>Assistant Secretary of the Navy</h3><ul><li>Appointed as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1913 by President Woodrow Wilson</li><li>Played a vital role in establishing the US Navy Reserve</li><li>Contributed to the establishment of the Council of National Defense</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Franklin-D.-Roosevelt-political-career-1024x585.jpg alt="Franklin D.

Through his involvement in both the New York State Senate and as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt honed his leadership skills, gained invaluable experience, and solidified his dedication to public service.</p><h2>Polio and Comeback</h2><p>In 1921, Franklin D. Roosevelt contracted polio or Guillain-Barre syndrome, which resulted in paralysis from the waist down. This health issue posed significant challenges for him both personally and professionally.</p><p>However, Roosevelt was determined to overcome his physical limitations. He embarked on a grueling rehabilitation journey, undergoing various treatments and therapies to regain strength and mobility. His perseverance and determination led him to establish the Roosevelt Rehabilitation Center in Warm Springs, Georgia, a facility aimed at helping not only himself but also others suffering from similar conditions.</p><p>Despite his paralysis, Roosevelt refused to let his physical disability hinder his political ambitions. In 1928, he successfully ran for the governorship of New York, marking an impressive political comeback. As governor, he implemented various programs to combat the devastating effects of the Great Depression.</p><p>“The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith.”</p><p>Roosevelt’s leadership during this challenging period earned him recognition for his efforts to improve the economy and provide relief to those in need. He displayed resilience, empathy, and a steadfast commitment to uplifting the nation.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Franklin-D.-Roosevelt-rehabilitation-center-1024x585.jpg alt="Franklin D.

His story serves as a testament to the human spirit’s ability to triumph over challenges and obstacles.</p><h2>First Presidential Term</h2><p>Franklin D. Roosevelt assumed office as the 32nd President of the United States in 1932, stepping into a nation grappling with the devastating effects of the Great Depression. In response to the economic crisis, Roosevelt introduced a series of groundbreaking initiatives under his New Deal program. These measures were designed to provide relief, promote economic recovery, and implement crucial reforms to prevent future financial catastrophes.</p><p>One of the key components of Roosevelt’s New Deal was the establishment of the National Recovery Administration (NRA). This agency aimed to regulate business practices, promote fair competition, and protect workers’ rights. Through the NRA, Roosevelt implemented industry codes of conduct and set minimum wage and maximum hour standards.</p><p>Another significant initiative of Roosevelt’s first term was the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA). This legislation aimed to stabilize agricultural prices and increase farmers’ income by addressing the problem of overproduction. The AAA provided financial incentives to farmers who reduced their production, ultimately restoring balance to the agricultural industry.</p><p>Roosevelt also focused on implementing regulatory reforms in various sectors, including finance, labor, and communications. These reforms were intended to restore trust in the banking system, improve working conditions, and enhance the efficiency of communication networks.</p><h3>The Impact of Roosevelt’s First Presidential Term</h3><p>“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” – Franklin D. Roosevelt</p><p>Roosevelt’s presidency was characterized by his ability to connect with the American people through his “fireside chats.” These radio broadcasts allowed him to directly address and reassure the nation during times of crisis. His empathetic and confident approach instilled hope and inspired confidence in the American people during the Great Depression.</p><p>The New Deal policies implemented during Roosevelt’s first term had a profound impact on the nation. They provided immediate relief to millions of Americans struggling in dire economic circumstances, sparking a path towards recovery. With these initiatives, Roosevelt set the stage for a more regulated and socially conscious economy, one that placed a greater emphasis on ensuring the well-being of its citizens.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Franklin-D.-Roosevelt-Presidency-1024x585.jpg alt="Franklin D.

Roosevelt was reelected for a second term in 1936 and a third term in 1940, making him the only president to serve more than two terms. Despite facing opposition from a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, Roosevelt managed to push forward with his progressive agenda and achieve significant accomplishments.</p><p>One of Roosevelt’s signature achievements during his second and third terms was the implementation of various New Deal programs and legislation. While some of his New Deal initiatives were struck down by the Supreme Court, such as the National Recovery Administration, many others were successfully enacted.</p><p>“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”</p><p>Roosevelt’s administration successfully implemented the National Labor Relations Act, also known as the Wagner Act, which established labor rights and protections for workers. This act allowed employees to engage in collective bargaining and join labor unions, ensuring better working conditions and fair treatment in the workplace.</p><p>Another significant achievement of Roosevelt’s presidency was the passing of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established the federal minimum wage, limits on working hours, and overtime pay for eligible workers. This legislation aimed to protect workers from exploitation and create a more equitable labor market.</p><p>Roosevelt also focused on reforming the financial sector and establishing regulatory bodies to prevent future economic crises. One notable accomplishment was the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates the securities industry and protects investors from fraudulent practices.</p><h3>Roosevelt’s Key Initiatives</h3><table><tr><th>New Deal Programs</th><th>Year</th></tr><tr><td>National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act)</td><td>1935</td></tr><tr><td>Fair Labor Standards Act</td><td>1938</td></tr><tr><td>Securities and Exchange Commission</td><td>1934</td></tr><tr><td>Social Security Act</td><td>1935</td></tr></table><p>Despite the challenges Roosevelt faced with the Supreme Court, his second and third terms marked a period of substantial progress in implementing labor laws and regulatory reforms.
