The actor contains <a href=#>multitudes</a> but is always Tom Hanks. As a result, he’s often accused of playing one character: the fundamentally decent, good-hearted, noble but humble all-American Everyman. There’s some truth to this, of course — Hanks wouldn’t work as Travis Bickle, no matter how hard he tried. But it’s not fair to paint Hanks as playing the same character over and over, and it certainly wouldn’t be fair to say he doesn’t challenge himself or take chances. Hanks has transformed himself from the party dude of Bachelor Party to the romantic lead of Sleepless in Seattle to the war hero of Saving Private Ryan to the six different characters he plays, amusingly, in Cloud Atlas. The guy may play only a certain number of notes, but he always manages to make them sound unique.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck38vgors00413g67nlxbk8xd@published data-word-count=58>Thus we present you with our complete ranking of Hanks’s movie roles, up to and including Asteroid City. A note: We limited our guide to live-action movies only, meaning his superb turns in the four Toy Story films aren’t on the list. It goes without saying that <a href=#>there’s never a bad time to watch a Toy Story movie</a>.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtndirz000x3h6b6gwqekpl@published>53. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Angels and Demons " href=#>Angels and Demons </a>(2009)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37ur4kl000q3g67z8kzuiko@published data-word-count=61>Hanks always looks a little ridiculous in these movies, and they’ve always felt like his one way to assure himself a studio hit; outside the Toy Story movies, they’re the only sequels he has ever done.

It’s cheapo schlock, but it’ll live forever because of Hanks’s appearance as a student who’s skeptical that the protagonist is really being stalked. His dialogue clearly sets him up to be murdered, but the filmmakers liked him so much that they decided to let his character live. Even in his first movie, Hanks was charming everybody.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtng7ug001b3h6bnwa7ewg7@published>51. <a data-vars-anchor-text="The Man With One Red Shoe" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>The Man With One Red Shoe</a> (1985)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37uriwh000w3g67yv788al7@published data-word-count=60>An instantly forgettable “comedy thriller” in which Hanks plays a doofus concert pianist thrust clumsily into a murder mystery.

This is another one of those roles, like Mr. Rogers or Ben Bradlee or Walt Disney himself (all parts he’s better at than this), in which Hanks is essentially cast simply for being Tom Hanks, which means all that really matters is what else he brings to the role. The answer here is “not much.” He stands where he’s supposed to stand and does not look actively embarrassed to be there — which, in this fiasco, requires considerable skill — but otherwise looks grateful to disappear for most of the movie.

James Ponsoldt is a smart director who would seem to have a natural affinity to this material, the cast is once-in-a-lifetime great (Emma Watson! John Boyega! Patton Oswalt! Bill Paxton’s last role!), and the time would seem right for a good hard look at what exactly the human tolls of massive corporate tech really are. Unfortunately, the movie is a fiasco from the start, confused, disorganized, and often nonsensical; this one just appears to have gotten away from Ponsoldt. Hanks could have been a perfect fit as the supposedly wise, benevolent Steve Jobs–type character who is secretly a supervillain, but the movie can’t focus enough on him to let him do much more than make a couple of speeches and then sneer lightly when he gets his comeuppance. It’s a shame: This would have been a great Tom Hanks bad guy performance if the movie had just let it happen.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtni6q9001l3h6bbycxzb1e@published>48. <a data-vars-anchor-text="The Bonfire of the Vanities" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>The Bonfire of the Vanities</a> (1990)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37uriwm000z3g67vzamanaq@published data-word-count=119>“I did everything I could to make it work,” Hanks<a href=#> said in 1992</a> about this Brian De Palma debacle. “And the fallout from it was that it makes you reflect for a while.

Hanks’s sincerity was never going to be a good fit with the Coens, but he does his best to get on their wavelength in a goofy, game-for-anything performance. The real problem here is that Hanks brings his A-game to a period of transition for the Coens, when they weren’t quite sure what their next step was going to be.

Sully never questions the man’s heroism, but Sully himself does, and Hanks’s portrayal is one in which self-doubt eats away at the character — which, coupled with having just survived a horrifying ordeal, leaves him feeling discombobulated and adrift.

But Hanks does commendable supporting work as a nerdy FBI agent on Abagnale’s trail — essentially playing the sort of conventional square whose mediocre life frightens the restless, rootless Abagnale. What’s funniest about Catch Me If You Can is how it represented a permanent shift in Hanks’s persona: The bratty upstart from Dragnet was now old enough (and established enough) to be the just-the-facts-ma’am law-and-order type.

Sprinkled with fairy dust and charm by late director Nora Ephron, Sleepless in Seattle is the epitome of feel-good, wish-fulfillment Hollywood love stories, and Hanks gives it a grounding that it very much needs.

Charlie Wilson’s War is deeply flawed — director Mike Nichols and writer Aaron Sorkin oversell the movie’s “colorful” world of vulgar CIA operatives and sassy Texas socialites — but Hanks gives the cartoonish story a moral center without sacrificing the tale’s more unbelievable moments and its dark punch line: Wilson’s seemingly patriotic actions will sow the seeds for Middle Eastern terrorism against the West.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtobyjw006g3h6b5gastyna@published>10. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Bridge of Spies" href=#>Bridge of Spies</a> (2015)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37urixu001y3g67dndrktc5@published data-word-count=118>Hanks’s innate decency plays a part in several films, but it’s delivered in a different way in this underrated Cold War drama.

Bridge of Spies is a movie about negotiation and compromise — about what principles we’re willing to sacrifice and which ones we can’t — and Donovan is heroic not because he’s the guy with the halo but because he’s shrewder and more determined than everyone he comes across.

A League of Their Own catches the actor in an interesting in-between spot in his career — he was rebounding from the failure of Bonfire of the Vanities, but not yet at the stage where he’d win back-to-back Oscars — and as such, it’s kind of a hoot to see him just bark at characters and be downright ornery. Of course, Dugan’s got a good heart underneath, and it’s the sort of one-note character that could have easily drifted into caricature, but Hanks elevates him through sheer force of his charisma and sweetness.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtodpaa006q3h6bac4uuncv@published>8. <a data-vars-anchor-text="A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" href=#>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</a> (2019)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck37urixv00213g6798223cxj@published data-word-count=165>Mr. Rogers is not in fact the main character in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood — that would be Matthew Rhys’s self-hating magazine journalist with daddy issues — and the movie benefits accordingly: Mr. Rogers, as played by Hanks, is so alien and unchanging and downright odd that building a plot around him would leave the movie nowhere to go. But that supporting shot of Hanks is the perfect amount: Hanks might be a little bit too big and a little bit too modern to truly inhabit Rogers, but the way he conjures his spirit, that quiet grace, is uncanny and even quite moving. Hanks never reaches for effect and remains spiritually and physically calm: His Mr. Rogers is unknowable, unfathomable, but absolutely irresistible. When a Mr. Rogers movie was announced, Hanks was such a logical choice the film nearly cast itself.

You never once believe Tom Hanks is on the wrong side here; that Hanks’s Bradlee is willing to question himself — is willing to admit his own mistakes — makes him that much easier, and important, to cheer for.

He’s scared, as would anyone be in that situation. The greatness of Saving Private Ryan can be measured in many ways — the harrowing brilliance of its opening battle sequence, the stunning desaturated images of war rendered by cinematographer Janusz Kamiński — but it’s ultimately a very human story, which is why Steven Spielberg cast Hollywood’s most reliable and relatable everyman star in the role. As the film pounds along and the body count builds, we learn that Miller was the kind of American hero World War II probably produced a lot of: an ordinary guy back home who turned himself into a leader of men because the fate of the planet hung in the balance.
