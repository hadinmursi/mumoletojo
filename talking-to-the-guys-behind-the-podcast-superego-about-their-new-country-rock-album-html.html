The show, which added members Mark McConville and Jeff Crocker early on, has developed a cult following since it began in 2006 and began attracting big-name guests from the comedy world like Paul F. Tompkins, Patton Oswalt, Jason Sudeikis, and Dan Harmon to name a few.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nrmzl12zkkv840j0s2ytn@published data-word-count=87>With Superego currently on hiatus, the gang is&nbsp;releasing a musical comedy album today called <a href=#>Mount Us More</a> from their fictional outlaw country-rock band The Journeymen (led by Superego characters Shunt McGuppin and Mutt Taylor). I recently had the chance to chat with Gourley, Carter, McConville, and musician James Bladon, who did an oustanding job of turning the gang’s funny songs into authentic-sounding country tunes. We discussed the new album, future Superego plans, and how Matt Gourley came into the possession of Waco cult leader David Koresh’s guitar.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nrmzl12zlkv84pypj1fld@published data-word-count=8><strong>How did you guys meet each other originally?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nrmzl12zmkv84mz4kmvb7@published data-word-count=37><strong>Matt Gourley: </strong>We were in a comedy group called ComedySportz.

We had this ridiculous job where we were paid – this is gonna sound really weird – but a bunch of us were paid to fly first class because some company found a loophole where they could earn more frequent flier points doing these flights, so they’d pay people like us fifty dollars a round trip to fly to Las Vegas or San Francisco. We’d do like three legs in a day, three round trips. Then, we’d hang out and watch World War II movies together.
