As reports trickled in, the situation began to clarify: Two people had been shot during a scene at Bonanza Creek Ranch in New Mexico. One of them, <a href=#>director of photography Halyna Hutchins</a>, died, while the other, director Joel Souza, was injured. Alec Baldwin, the film’s star and one of its producers, “discharged” the gun. But the developments have left many unanswered questions and concerns. How did a fatal shooting happen with what was reportedly a prop? How common are injuries from guns on film sets? Who is responsible? The Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office investigation into the incident has concluded, <a href=#>per Deadline</a>.<strong> </strong>On October 27, 2022, the sheriff’s office delivered its report to New Mexico’s district attorney, who worked with investigators and prosecutors to determine criminal charges.<strong> </strong>As a result, Baldwin and armorer<strong> </strong>Hannah Gutierrez-Reed<strong> </strong>are <a href=#>each charged with involuntary manslaughter,</a> the New Mexico district attorney announced on January 19, 2023. <a href=#>Per The Wrap</a>, Baldwin pleaded not guilty on February 23, 2023 and waived his first scheduled court appearance.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cld3boh4p000m3b6v78atcmp1@published data-word-count=85>On the civil side of things, Baldwin filed a negligence lawsuit against several crew members on November 11, 2022, <a href=#>Deadline reported</a>, alleging that they caused the tragedy. The complaint states that the actor is “seeking to clear his name,” adding that he has been fired from jobs and lost career opportunities due to the incident. Then, in <a href=#>December 2022</a>, Rust assistant director Dave Halls countersued Baldwin and other crew members. Below, everything we do and don’t know about the fatal shooting on set of Rust.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv2fu2vo001y3h6gym09f2ou@published>What happened?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckv2gl8xb002e3h6gl6uaw9da@published data-word-count=96>The Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office received a call at 1:50 p.m. MT on October 21, 2021 reporting a shooting on a film set,<strong> </strong>per a police statement provided to Vulture. Investigators later confirmed that Alec Baldwin “discharged” the gun at the Bonanza Creek Ranch set, shooting two people: Hutchins and Souza. The sheriff’s office <a href=#>told the New York Times</a> the shooting occurred during a scene that was either being rehearsed or filmed. The Los Angeles Times later reported that Baldwin had been rehearsing a scene that involved shooting the gun outside the church on set.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckv2utmcs000z3h6gewa4jdfn@published data-word-count=84>The statement from the sheriff’s office said a helicopter took Hutchins to the University of New Mexico Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. An ambulance transported Souza to Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center to be treated for his injuries. <a href=#>Deadline reported</a> Souza had been released from the hospital early the next day.<strong> </strong>A spokesperson for Rust Movie Productions told Vulture that production on the film has been paused to comply with the investigation and to provide counseling to people working on the film.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckv36e48x000k3e6ihsg5c35a@published data-word-count=168><a href=#>The AP reported</a> on October 22, 2021 that court records indicate that Baldwin was told before the fatal incident that the gun had no ammunition. The film’s armorer, a term for the person in charge of gun props, was Hannah Gutierrez-Reed.&nbsp;Per the court records, she set three guns on a cart outside of the area where the scene was being acted. According to a search warrant application obtained by the AP, assistant director Dave Halls then brought one of the guns to Baldwin, not knowing that it was loaded with live rounds.

Brandon Bruce Lee, the son of action star Bruce Lee, died in an on-set shooting in 1993 after being hit with a bullet during a scene for The Crow. While the gun used in that scene was loaded with blank rounds, it had not been properly cleared of the dummy rounds loaded for previous scenes after one was lodged in the barrel of the gun. That caused the blank to propel the dummy round out of the barrel, striking Lee. The police investigation found Lee’s death to be due to negligence rather than foul play and no charges were filed. However, Lee’s mother filed a negligence lawsuit against the film’s producers and director and the effects contractor that supplied the ammunition, which was settled out of court. Lee’s sister, Shannon, who runs a Twitter account in his name, tweeted condolences to Hutchins and Souza. “No one should ever be killed by a gun on a film set,” she wrote. “Period. 💔”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and to Joel Souza and all involved in the incident on “Rust”.

It is a privilege to see this through on her behalf.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckv2pcq1y000l3e6je9fhpjt5@published data-word-count=6>This story has been updated throughout.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl013q9b20000t1oluqdz1ecz@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Halyna Hutchins’s Husband Says Alec Baldwin’s Defense Is ‘Absurd’</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl8vqtitj0000dnhu4vmoqwk3@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Alec Baldwin and Rust Producers Settle Lawsuit With Halyna Hutchins’s Family</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckv2dcg6v0000jjolyui49ifl@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Film Industry Reacts to the Death of Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Everything We Know About Alec Baldwin’s Rust Trial</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdganyiuMScZJuZnJnEqrqMq6ysrF2otbC706KloGWnna61eceap6mdnpqxbrPUp2SdnaSWtq2%2FjaGrpqQ%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2falec-baldwin-rust-shooting-what-happened-gun-details-html.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20the%20Rust%20Shooting%20and%20Alec%20Baldwins%20Trial" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falec-baldwin-rust-shooting-what-happened-gun-details-html.html&description=Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20the%20Rust%20Shooting%20and%20Alec%20Baldwins%20Trial" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falec-baldwin-rust-shooting-what-happened-gun-details-html.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20the%20Rust%20Shooting%20and%20Alec%20Baldwins%20Trial" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2falec-baldwin-rust-shooting-what-happened-gun-details-html.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20the%20Rust%20Shooting%20and%20Alec%20Baldwins%20Trial" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2falec-baldwin-rust-shooting-what-happened-gun-details-html.html&text=Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20the%20Rust%20Shooting%20and%20Alec%20Baldwins%20Trial" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2falec-baldwin-rust-shooting-what-happened-gun-details-html.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Kelle Repass</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-08-19</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./fresh-prince-of-bel-air-cast-where-are-they-now.html><h3>&lt;&lt;
