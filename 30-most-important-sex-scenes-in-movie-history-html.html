They’ve gone through periods of near-ubiquity, as well as scarcity. In the 1960s and ‘70s, they were often used for shock value and to shake viewer complacency. In the 1980s, they were commodified in startling ways. These days, they tend to be relatively rare. But sex scenes have also been&nbsp;<i>important</i>&nbsp;— whether in the development of the cinematic idiom, or sparking controversy, or just plain helping break new ground in depicting intimacy. Some of the scenes on this list are seminal moments in film history (for better and for worse). Some are flash points that wound up changing our culture in interesting ways. Some came to represent nefarious, exploitative trends. And some are just unforgettable scenes that informed what came after them. It’s a mixed bunch. Here are the&nbsp;30 Most Important Sex Scenes in Movie History<b>.</b></p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8ov7lnp002n3d5xvdajt9l5@published>30. Ecstasy</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8ov8c86002s3d5xw1udzhyd@published data-word-count=108>In this 1933 Czech film, the great Hedy Lamarr plays a young, frustrated bride who flees her marriage to a wealthy, impotent older man and finds love and lust in the arms of a virile engineer. This may have been the first documented sex scene in cinema. But interestingly, although the film itself contains copious nudity (including a famous, extended scene of Lamarr skinny-dipping) the sex scene itself is largely demure. That’s not to say it’s not erotic, however. Indeed, by focusing largely on the characters’ faces (and by showing Lamarr’s character achieving orgasm — probably another first for cinema), director Gustav Machaty conveys the thrill of intimacy.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8ov92wf002w3d5x0akq4hmx@published>29. Little Vera</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8ov9oz100303d5xqdect705@published data-word-count=86>This 1988 film, released at the height of perestroika, made waves in both the USSR and the West for being (reportedly) the first Soviet film to feature a naked sex scene. It’s a drab little melodrama of two star-crossed young lovers whose families do not approve of their relationship, but the scenes of intimacy between star Natalya Negoda and&nbsp;Andrei Sokolov are earthy and lived-in — a far cry from the slick sex scenes of Hollywood. (That didn’t keep star Negoda from posing in Playboy, of course.)</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8ova44800343d5x6pd9cqcz@published>28.

Back when it was released, Vincent Gallo’s arthouse provocation was known for two things: Being blasted at Cannes by critics (particularly by the late Roger Ebert, who would later praise Gallo’s final, shorter cut) and for its allegedly unsimulated, lengthy scene of fellatio by Chloë Sevigny. Was it unsimulated? Who can say. Some say Gallo was using a prosthetic; Gallo (of course) claims he was not.

Many in the gay community felt the film was homophobic and were worried about the portrait of homosexuals in the film. Even though the film was based on a real case and was mostly a genre movie, Friedkin himself understood their concerns. In an <a href=#>interview last year</a>, he told us: “[T]he timing of it was difficult because of what had been happening to gay people … Cruising came out around a time that gay liberation had made enormous strides among the general public. It also came out around the same time that AIDS was given a name … But many critics who wrote for gay publications or the underground press felt that the film was not the best foot forward as far as gay liberation was concerned, and they were right.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8ovbgef003m3d5x0ycrzscl@published>26.

But in the late ‘60s, it became the biggest foreign hit on U.S. shores, thanks to its somewhat explicit scenes featuring the film’s protagonist, Lena Nyman, a sexually liberated student. The film is a docu-narrative hybrid, so it’s rarely clear if what we’re seeing onscreen is real or staged. But what really intrigued audiences (and outraged censors) was a scene where Lena kisses a boyfriend’s limp penis.

But it could be argued that the early, looking-in-the-mirror sex scene between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman was more significant. First, it’s beautiful, and it elegantly captures the film’s through-the-looking-glass atmosphere. But it’s also important because this scene also served as the film’s trailer, and by foregrounding the sex to such a degree, it may have (along with unfounded and inaccurate rumors from the set) helped raise expectations that Kubrick’s final work would be some kind of mythically explicit fuck-fest. That then set up many critics and audiences for inevitable disappointment, when they discovered that the film was, indeed, a curiously old-fashioned thriller that was uninterested in titillation or breaking taboos. Still, this scene’s kind of great. Cruise and Kidman never particularly had much chemistry, but here, Kubrick seems to play off that idea: She’s more interested in seeing herself than she is in him, and the look of urgency on his face is more that of a man in desperation than it is one of arousal or love. This scene helps unlock the movie’s many mysteries.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8ovct9300423d5x1mtxoyiq@published>24.

(Remember, this is the man who made The Right Stuff.) But its historical significance cannot be denied: This was the film that earned the MPAA’s first NC-17, a rating that was created after they realized that the X rating, which had been appropriated by the porn industry, just wasn’t cutting it. The film has several lengthy sex scenes, but the one that reportedly flipped the MPAA out was a scene in a brothel where Anaïs Nin, after falling for June Miller, selects two girls who look like her and June, and makes them have sex with each other. At one point, the blonde girl looks up and asks Anaïs if she wants something different. “Yes, stop pretending to be a man,” Anaïs responds, at which point the girl starts to go down on the other one.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8ovfyoa004d3d5xedm7bnjl@published>23. 9 ½ Weeks</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8ovgay6004h3d5xesiaw338@published data-word-count=64>Let’s face it, this is a terrible movie.

The two characters are brought together by profound grief, with one bottling it in and the other letting it out. That’s one reason why the film’s pivotal, controversial, drunken sex scene — with Berry’s character repeatedly moaning, “Make me feel good!” — might be its most powerful moment. It might also be why so many people find the scene offensive and debasing. Of course, the character is debased at this moment — debased, vulnerable, needy. It’s a troubling scene, to be sure.

And maybe it is, to some extent. But The Terminator didn’t turn out to be any old ‘80s action movie, and director James Cameron wasn’t your typical action director. The film became a massive hit that spawned a decades-old franchise (with a new one coming out next summer) and a fairly elaborate, time-hopping mythology. Most of that mythology involves one John Connor, leader of the human resistance against the machines in the future.

To some extent, that was a response to the conservative production codes of the era, but it also lent the films a kind of latent sexual tension: We couldn’t see the characters having sex, so we imagined them having sex for the whole film. But in the ‘70s and ‘80s, we got to see the sex. And in Body Heat, we got to see a lot of it, as William Hurt’s lawyer and Kathleen Turner’s alluring, married socialite found themselves having a torrid, fatal, James M. Cain–ian affair. Indeed, it’s hard to pick one particular sex scene among the many featured in this film, but we’ll go with the mostly clothed one in which Turner, playing vulnerable but never taking her eyes off him, strangely seduces Hurt into breaking into her own house. After 1981, whenever anyone referred to a “steamy legal thriller” — and, curiously, people often did — visions of Body Heat began to dance in everyone’s heads.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8ovnzea00633d5x5inx2f3v@published>15.

Much of the story revolves around Jesus (Willem Dafoe) realizing while on the cross that he isn’t the Messiah, stepping down, and proceeding to lead a normal life and growing old — before it’s revealed that his “normal” life has been a ruse by Satan himself. And although this extended dream of a normal life turns out to be just that — a dream — it also features one short scene of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, whom he marries, having sex (complete with a Jesus butt shot!). That infuriated many, in the U.S. and elsewhere, and soon enough, the film was being protested all over the world, often by people who hadn’t actually seen it. In America, the controversy over the film provided an opportunity for the religious right to cohere and coalesce around a single, headline-grabbing issue — a model for future action.

The Wachowskis said that was a concern of theirs, too, so they decided to shoot that love scene in one long, continuous shot … [They] put the camera on a crane, and there were all these elements that they wanted to capture. They wanted to start out on a safe and get the side of my back, and they wanted to pan down to the toes, and they would be yelling through a megaphone, telling us what different parts were onscreen. They would yell, ‘Toes!’ and Gina would curl her toes like she was about to come. Then they would say, ‘Hand!’ and my hand was on her crotch, and I would kind of move my fingers a little bit.

The claim has been refuted by some, but it’s easy to believe: The casual intensity, the sheer physicality of the scene is quite unlike anything you’ve seen. But it’s not just a hot ‘n steamy sex scene we’re talking about here: This is a couple experiencing profound grief, and the desperation with which they cling to each other is poignant, too.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>30 Most Important Sex Scenes in Movie History</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobWdhZ3x0fIympqysXZ66sbvRrZinrF2osrl50pycp52jYravecyoraKdXZ22tMDOq7BnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2f30-most-important-sex-scenes-in-movie-history-html.html&title=The%2030%20Most%20Important%20Sex%20Scenes%20in%20Movie%20History%20" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f30-most-important-sex-scenes-in-movie-history-html.html&description=The%2030%20Most%20Important%20Sex%20Scenes%20in%20Movie%20History%20" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f30-most-important-sex-scenes-in-movie-history-html.html&title=The%2030%20Most%20Important%20Sex%20Scenes%20in%20Movie%20History%20" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2f30-most-important-sex-scenes-in-movie-history-html.html&title=The%2030%20Most%20Important%20Sex%20Scenes%20in%20Movie%20History%20" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2f30-most-important-sex-scenes-in-movie-history-html.html&text=The%2030%20Most%20Important%20Sex%20Scenes%20in%20Movie%20History%20" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2f30-most-important-sex-scenes-in-movie-history-html.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Kelle Repass</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-09-04</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./bachelor-season-19-chris-soules-bachelorettes-2014412.html><h3>&lt;&lt; The Bachelor Season 19: Meet Chris Soules' Bachelorettes!</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./thanksgiving-movies-to-watch-turkey-drop-and-more.html><h3>Thanksgiving Movies to Watch: Turkey Drop and More >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
