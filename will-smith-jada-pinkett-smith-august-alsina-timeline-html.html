Let us explain.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcoydr5y000jp1ofzqfvhpq9@published data-word-count=114>How’s this for a slap in the face? Jada Pinkett Smith and her husband, Will Smith, have been secretly separated since 2016. The news of their now-seven-year-long separation comes as a shock to the public, which has witnessed the pair booed up on red carpets, oversharing intimate details about their relationship, and standing up for each other when a petty comedian made a stupid joke and got slapped for it. There were a few signs to marital discord that the power couple couldn’t hide, though. In 2020, <a href=#>Jada Pinkett Smith brought herself to the Red Table</a> and revealed that she’d had a relationship with R&B singer <a href=#>August Alsina</a> while “temporarily” separated from her husband.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnm649xf000j3b825oslgzw0@published data-word-count=103>While Will and Jada promised to lay their cards on the table a few years back, hindsight proves that a lot was left unanswered.<strong> </strong>Why did the couple separate and keep it a secret? Why did she decide to share the news? Were she and Will in an open relationship before the separation? What exactly is an entanglement? As such, we took it upon ourselves to map out the complete timeline of Will and Jada’s relationship, from meeting on the set of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to sitting across from each other at the Red Table<strong> </strong>to Jada’s latest act of oversharing.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcoygsrc000x3h68q09cdmy6@published data-word-count=53><strong>1994</strong>: Will Smith and Jada Pinkett meet on the set of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air when Jada auditions to play Smith’s girlfriend.

But my mother was like, ‘You have to get married’ — she’s so old-school — and Will wanted a family. So I said, ‘All right, maybe it’s something I should do.’”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckcp14j9g00283h68bw9r8a88@published data-word-count=23><strong>July 8, 1998</strong>: Will and Jada’s first child together, Jaden Smith, is born.

However, on this day in 2011 the couple releases a joint statement to combat rumors that <a href=#>Jada was dating her Hawthorne co-star, Latin music superstar and J.Lo’s husband at the time, Marc Anthony</a>. “Although we are reluctant to respond to these types of press reports, the rumors circulating about our relationship are completely false.

He accepts me for the human that I am, and we want to love each other there.” She suggests they might even “live in the same house” now.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnm7kbah00263b823f4jvoze@published data-word-count=6>This post has been updated throughout.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clnnl8nvj00000igrwcp51mgo@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Jada Pinkett-Smith Is the Queen of Contradictory Spin</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clnls5iw9000k0ih6aqlxmqn0@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith Aren’t As Entangled As We Thought</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl26gbu9s0000jinak3008ts3@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Red Table Talk Season Five Is Here to Heal</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>A Timeline of Will and Jada’s ‘Bad Marriage for Life’</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny4tculZKylmam1brbAnZhmqJmjuKbA02aqpqGknXqiwcauqq1lkaHAqrrAZquipZWhtq%2BxjaGrpqQ%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fwill-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-august-alsina-timeline-html.html&title=A%20Timeline%20of%20Will%20and%20Jadas%20Bad%20Marriage%20for%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwill-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-august-alsina-timeline-html.html&description=A%20Timeline%20of%20Will%20and%20Jadas%20Bad%20Marriage%20for%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwill-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-august-alsina-timeline-html.html&title=A%20Timeline%20of%20Will%20and%20Jadas%20Bad%20Marriage%20for%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fwill-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-august-alsina-timeline-html.html&title=A%20Timeline%20of%20Will%20and%20Jadas%20Bad%20Marriage%20for%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fwill-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-august-alsina-timeline-html.html&text=A%20Timeline%20of%20Will%20and%20Jadas%20Bad%20Marriage%20for%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fwill-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-august-alsina-timeline-html.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Tandra Barner</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-08-22</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./alma-kuc-wikipedia-biography-age-height-instagram-boyfriend.html><h3>&lt;&lt;
